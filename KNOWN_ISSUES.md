# Known Issues

## RF/ADC phases not accurate

- **Issue**: RF and ADC phases displayed in the waveform diagram is not accurate.
- **Workaround**: None currently available. Please verify phase information using other tools.

## Wrong redering on Linux

- **Issue**: Waveforms in diferent blocks may shown as connected.
- **Workaround**: Zoom in to see the waveforms correctly rendered.

## UI lag with large sequences
- **Issue**: The user interface may become laggy or even freeze when loading or displaying large sequences.
- **Workaround**: Try to make the sequence smaller by reducing:
  - Number of slices, number of repetitions, number of diffusion directions, etc. 
  - Use the TR-segmented render mode instead of rendering the entire sequence, this will need the TR or RepetitionTime definition in the .seq file.
